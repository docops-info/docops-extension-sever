== Introduction

The DocOps Timeline Extension allows you to create visually appealing timeline visualizations in your AsciiDoctor documents. Timelines are useful for displaying chronological events, project milestones, historical dates, and other time-based information.

This guide will help you understand how to include timelines in your AsciiDoctor documents and provide examples of different timeline configurations.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Timelines?

Timelines in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that display a series of events along a horizontal line. Each timeline has:

* A title (the main heading of the timeline)
* A series of events, each with a date and descriptive text
* Events are displayed alternating above and below the timeline
* Optional display settings for customizing the appearance

=== Timeline Components

A timeline includes:

* A title
* A horizontal timeline road with directional arrow
* Multiple event entries, each containing:
  ** A date
  ** Descriptive text (which can include links)
* Display settings for visual appearance

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Timelines

To include timelines in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Project Timeline",scale="1",role="center"]
----

date: 1891
text: Mailbox, invented by Phillip Downing
-

for [[https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj asciidoctorj]]. With a simple text markup block you can
create very powerful timeline images. Enjoy!

....

The macro processes the timeline entries and generates an SVG representation that is embedded in your document.

=== Timeline Properties

==== Macro Properties

* `title` (optional): The main heading of the timeline
* `scale` (optional): A scaling factor for the timeline (default: 1.0)
* `role` (optional): The role attribute for the timeline (e.g., "center" to center the timeline)
* `useDark` (optional): Whether to use dark mode (default: false)
* `outlineColor` (optional): The color for the timeline outline (default: "#37cdbe")


==== Entry Properties

Each entry in the timeline has the following properties:

* `date` (required): The date or time label for the event
* `text` (required): The descriptive text for the event

=== Timeline Entry Syntax

Each timeline entry starts with a `-` on a new line, followed by the date and text properties:

[source,asciidoc]
....
-
date: January 1, 2023
text: This is the first event in the timeline
-
date: February 15, 2023
text: This is the second event in the timeline
....

The text property can span multiple lines and can include links using the syntax `\[[url display_text]]` (without the backslash):

[source,asciidoc]
....
-
date: March 10, 2023
text: This event includes a link to \[[https://docops.io DocOps.io]]
and spans multiple lines for longer descriptions
....

== Examples

=== Basic Timeline Example

Here's a simple example of a timeline:
