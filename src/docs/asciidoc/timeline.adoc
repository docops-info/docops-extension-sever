Timelines transform chronological events into visual narratives. Whether documenting project milestones, product history, or organizational evolution, timelines make sequences immediately understandable and memorable.

=== Key Features

* *Alternating placement* - Events alternate above/below for balanced design
* *Multi-line support* - Descriptions can span multiple lines with links
* *Date flexibility* - Use any date format (Q1 2024, Jan 15, etc.)
* *Interactive elements* - Clickable items with expandable details

== Best Practices

* *Use consistent date formats* - Q1 2024, Jan 2024, or specific dates (not mixed)
* *Keep descriptions brief* - 1-2 sentences per event for scanability
* *Order chronologically* - Left-to-right flow should match time progression
* *Limit to 6-10 events* - More events create visual clutter
* *Link to details* - Use links for deep dives rather than cramming text

[TIP]
====
For project roadmaps, use quarters (Q1 2024) rather than specific dates. This gives you flexibility if delivery dates shift while keeping the timeline accurate.
