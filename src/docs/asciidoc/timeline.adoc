== Introduction

The DocOps Timeline Extension allows you to create visually appealing timeline visualizations in your AsciiDoctor documents. Timelines are useful for displaying chronological events, project milestones, historical dates, and other time-based information.

This guide will help you understand how to include timelines in your AsciiDoctor documents and provide examples of different timeline configurations.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Timelines?

Timelines in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that display a series of events along a horizontal line. Each timeline has:

* A title (the main heading of the timeline)
* A series of events, each with a date and descriptive text
* Events are displayed alternating above and below the timeline
* Optional display settings for customizing the appearance

=== Timeline Components

A timeline includes:

* A title
* A timeline road (horizontal or vertical)
* Multiple event entries, each containing:
  ** A date
  ** Descriptive text (which can include links)
* Optional clickable items to show detailed information
* Display settings for visual appearance

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Timelines

To include timelines in your AsciiDoctor document, use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Project Timeline",scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
-
date: 1891
text: Mailbox, invented by Phillip Downing
-
date: 1923
text: The Three-Light Traffic Signal, invented by Garrett Morgan
-
date: 1932
text: Automatic Gear Shift, invented by Richard Spikes
-
date: July 23rd, 2023
text: DocOps extension Server releases a new feature, Timeline Maker
for [[https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj asciidoctorj]]. With a simple text markup block you can
create very powerful timeline images. Enjoy!
-
date: August 15th, 2023
text: DocOps.io revamping website with updated documentation. All
our work will be updated with latest documentation for Panels,
for extension server are the various plug-ing for asciidoctorj.
----
....

The macro processes the timeline entries and generates an SVG representation that is embedded in your document.

=== Timeline Properties

==== Macro Properties

* `scale` (optional): A scaling factor for the timeline (default: 1.0)
* `role` (optional): The role attribute for the timeline (e.g., "center" to center the timeline)
* `useDark` (optional): Whether to use dark mode (default: false)




==== Entry Properties

Each entry in the timeline has the following properties:

* `date` (required): The date or time label for the event
* `text` (required): The descriptive text for the event

=== Timeline Entry Syntax

Each timeline entry starts with a `-` on a new line, followed by the date and text properties:

[source,asciidoc]
....
-
date: January 1, 2023
text: This is the first event in the timeline
-
date: February 15, 2023
text: This is the second event in the timeline
....

The text property can span multiple lines and can include links using the syntax `\[[url display_text]]` (without the backslash):

[source,asciidoc]
....
-
date: March 10, 2023
text: This event includes a link to \[[https://docops.io DocOps.io]]
and spans multiple lines for longer descriptions
....

== Examples

=== Vertical Timeline

To create a vertical timeline with entries arranged horizontally along a horizontal spine:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Project Milestones",scale="1"]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline1.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="Project Milestones",scale="1"]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline1.txt[]
----

The vertical timeline now features an API-style layout where entries alternate above and below the timeline, creating a more condensed and balanced design. This layout is particularly useful for displaying version histories, release timelines, or any sequence of events where the chronological order is important.

Key features of the vertical timeline:

* Entries alternate between positions above and below the horizontal timeline
* Compact card design with a white background and subtle drop shadow
* Concentric circle markers at the intersection of each entry with the timeline
* Small colored indicator in the corner of each card
* Straight connector lines between cards and timeline markers

=== Standard Examples

=== Basic Timeline Example

Here's a simple example of a timeline:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Project Timeline",scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline2.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="Project Timeline",scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline2.txt[]
----

=== Timeline with Multiple Events

You can add as many events as needed to your timeline:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Project Timeline",scale="1",role="center"]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline3.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="Project Timeline",scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline3.txt[]
----

=== Timeline with Links

You can include links in your timeline entries using the `\[[url display_text]]` syntax (without the backslash):

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Project Timeline with Links",scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline4.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="Project Timeline with Links",scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline4.txt[]
----


=== Timeline with Dark Mode

You can create a timeline with dark mode by setting the `useDark` parameter to `true`:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Space Exploration Timeline",scale="1",role="center",useDark="true"]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline5.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="Space Exploration Timeline",scale="1",role="center",useDark="true",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline5.txt[]
----

=== Timeline with Custom Outline Color

You can customize the timeline's appearance by changing the outline color:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Evolution of Computing",scale="1",role="center",outlineColor="#FF5733",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline6.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="Evolution of Computing",scale="1",role="center",outlineColor="#FF5733",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline6.txt[]
----

=== Educational Timeline Example

Timelines are excellent for educational content, such as this timeline of literary movements:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Major Literary Movements",scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline7.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="Major Literary Movements",scale="1",role="center",outlineColor="#4B0082",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline7.txt[]
----


=== Product Roadmap Timeline

Timelines are perfect for visualizing product roadmaps and future plans:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="DocOps Product Roadmap 2024",scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline8.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="DocOps Product Roadmap 2024",scale="1",role="center",outlineColor="#008080",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline8.txt[]
----

=== Styling Options

You can customize the visual appearance of timelines using the `useGlass` attribute. By default, timelines use a glass-like styling with transparency and highlights on a blue background. You can disable this to use a more traditional flat design:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Traditional Style Timeline",scale="1",role="center"]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline9.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,scale="1",role="center",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline9.txt[]
----

You can also combine the glass styling with dark mode for a sleek, modern look:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,timeline,title="Modern Glass Timeline",scale="1",role="center",useDark="true",useGlass="true"]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline10.txt[]
----
....

[docops,timeline,title="Modern Glass Timeline",scale="1",role="center",useDark="true",useGlass="true",controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline10.txt[]
----

=== Vertical Orientation

[docops,timeline,controls=true]
----
include::data/timeline/timeline11.txt[]
----
