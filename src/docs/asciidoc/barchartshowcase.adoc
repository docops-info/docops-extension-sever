= DocOps BarChart Showcase

[abstract]
The purpose of this document is to showcase the DocOps Bar Chart capabilities. It provides a gallery of example bar and grouped-bar charts generated from simple data files using the docops macro. Use it as a reference to:
- understand which chart types are available and how they render in light and dark modes
- see how to enable interactive controls and supply data from external files
- copy working snippets when authoring your own charts in documentation
