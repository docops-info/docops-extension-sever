== Overview

The DocOps WordCloud Extension allows you to create visually appealing word clouds to highlight key terms and their relative importance. Word clouds are a great way to visualize text data where the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.

== Features

* Interactive SVG-based word clouds
* Customizable dimensions, colors, and font sizes
* Individual color assignment for each word
* Hover effects for better user interaction
* Support for both light and dark themes
* Automatic word placement algorithm to avoid overlaps

== Usage

To create a word cloud, use the `wordcloud` block type in your AsciiDoc document:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,wordcloud,controls=true]
----
include::data/wordcloud/wordcloud1.txt[]
----
....

[docops,wordcloud]
----
include::data/wordcloud/wordcloud1.txt[]
----

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

== Parsing Format

Word clouds use the unified parsing framework provided by the DocOps Extension Server. The content is divided into two sections:

1. **Configuration Section**: Contains key-value pairs in the format `key=value` before the `---` separator
2. **Data Section**: Contains the word data after the separator in a tabular format

For more information about the parsing framework, see the xref:parsing.adoc[Parsing Utilities] documentation.

== Configuration Parameters

The word cloud can be customized using the following configuration parameters:

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Parameter |Default |Description

|title
|Word Cloud
|The title displayed at the top of the word cloud

|width
|800
|The width of the word cloud in pixels

|height
|600
|The height of the word cloud in pixels

|minFontSize
|10
|The minimum font size for words with the lowest weight

|maxFontSize
|60
|The maximum font size for words with the highest weight

|darkMode
|false
|Whether to use a dark theme (true) or light theme (false)

|baseColor
|#3498db
|The default color for words without a specific color

|shape
|rectangle
|The shape of the word cloud (currently supports "rectangle")

|scale
|1.0
|A scaling factor for the entire word cloud
|===

== Word Data Format

After the configuration section and the separator line (`---`), each line represents a word in the format:

[source]
----
Word | Weight | Color
----

Where:

* `Word` is the text to display
* `Weight` is a numeric value that determines the relative size of the word (higher values = larger font)
* `Color` is an optional hex color code (e.g., #3498db) for the word

== Technical Implementation

The word cloud is generated as an SVG with the following features:

* Words are arranged in a spiral pattern to maximize space usage
* A collision detection algorithm ensures words don't overlap
* Each word has a gradient effect based on its color
* Words have a subtle drop shadow for depth
* Interactive hover effects (scaling and brightness change)
* Random rotation of some words for visual interest

== Integration

The word cloud extension integrates seamlessly with AsciiDoctor documents and can be used in any DocOps-enabled documentation.
