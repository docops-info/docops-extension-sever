= DocOps ADR

== Introduction

The DocOps ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Extension allows you to create visually appealing architecture decision records in your AsciiDoctor documents. ADRs are a way to document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of ADRs, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of ADR visualizations.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Architecture Decision Records?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each ADR has:

* A title (the main heading of the ADR)
* Status (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated, or Rejected)
* Date of the decision
* Context (the factors that influenced the decision)
* Decision (the actual decision made)
* Consequences (the results of the decision)
* Participants (the people involved in making the decision)

The extension supports various display options, including:

* Light mode (default)
* Dark mode
* Different status colors

=== ADR Components

An ADR includes:

* A title
* Status and date information
* Context section
* Decision section
* Consequences section
* Participants section with stick figure representations

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for ADRs

To include ADRs in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,adr]
----
title: ADR title
status: Accepted
date: YYYY-MM-DD
context: Context point 1
- Context point 2
decision: Decision point 1
- Decision point 2
consequences: Consequence 1
Consequence 2
participants: Jane Smith (Architect), John Doe (Developer), Alice Johnson (Product Manager)
----
....

The macro processes the JSON configuration and generates an SVG representation of the ADR that is embedded in your document.

=== ADR Properties

==== Main Properties

* `title` (required): The main heading of the ADR
* `date` (required): The date when the decision was made
* `status` (required): The status of the decision (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated, or Rejected)
* `context` (required): An array of context statements
* `decision` (required): An array of decision statements
* `consequences` (required): An array of consequence statements
* `participants` (optional): An array of participant names

==== Multiline Participants

The `participants` field supports multiline formatting, allowing you to list participants on separate lines for better readability. This is particularly useful when you have many participants or when participant names include roles or other information.

You can format participants in two ways:

1. **Single line with commas**:
+
[source]
----
participants: Jane Smith (Architect), John Doe (Developer), Alice Johnson (Product Manager)
----

2. **Multiple lines**:
+
[source]
----
participants:
Jane Smith (Architect),
John Doe (Developer),
Alice Johnson (Product Manager)
----
+
Or:
+
[source]
----
participants:
Jane Smith (Architect)
John Doe (Developer)
Alice Johnson (Product Manager)
----

Both formats will be correctly parsed and displayed in the ADR visualization.

==== Interactive Participants

The participants section includes several interactive features to enhance collaboration:

1. **Hover Effects**: When you hover over a participant, a subtle glow effect is applied to highlight the participant.

2. **Email Detection**: The system automatically detects email addresses in participant names. For example:
+
[source]
----
participants: Jane Smith (jane.smith@example.com), John Doe (john.doe@example.com)
----

3. **Microsoft Teams Chat Links**: Participants with email addresses are automatically linked to Microsoft Teams chat. Clicking on a participant with an email will open a new Teams chat with that person.

4. **Group Chat Link**: When two or more participants have email addresses, a "Start Group Chat" link appears in the participants section. Clicking this link will open a Microsoft Teams group chat with all participants who have email addresses.

[TIP]
====
To make the most of these interactive features:

* Include email addresses in parentheses after participant names
* Format: `Name (email@example.com)`
* For organization-specific Teams integration, ensure you're using the correct email domain
====

==== Status Options

[TIP]
====
The `status` property can have one of the following values:

* `Proposed`: Indicates a decision that is being considered (blue)
* `Accepted`: Indicates a decision that has been approved (green)
* `Superseded`: Indicates a decision that has been replaced by a newer decision (amber)
* `Deprecated`: Indicates a decision that is no longer relevant (red)
* `Rejected`: Indicates a decision that was not approved (dark red)
====

=== Wiki Style Links

The ADR extension supports wiki style links in all text fields. This allows you to add hyperlinks to external resources or internal references within your ADRs.

==== Wiki Style Link Syntax

To add a wiki style link, use the following syntax:

[source]
----
[[URL LABEL]]
----

Where:

* `URL` is the full URL of the linked resource
* `LABEL` is the text that will be displayed and linked

For example:

[source]
----
[[https://www.example.com Example Website]]
----

This will render as a clickable link with "Example Website" as the visible text.

==== Examples of Wiki Style Links in ADRs

Wiki style links can be used in any text field of an ADR, including:

* Context points
* Decision points
* Consequences
* Participant information

Example usage in a decision point:

[source]
----
- We will use [[https://kubernetes.io/ Kubernetes]] for container orchestration
----

Example usage in a context point:

[source]
----
- Our current architecture is described in [[https://internal-wiki.example.com/architecture Architecture Wiki]]
----

[TIP]
====
Wiki style links are particularly useful for:

* Linking to technical documentation
* Referencing design documents
* Pointing to standards or best practices
* Connecting to related ADRs
====
