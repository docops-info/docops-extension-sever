= DocOps ADR

== Introduction

The DocOps ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Extension allows you to create visually appealing architecture decision records in your AsciiDoctor documents. ADRs are a way to document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of ADRs, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of ADR visualizations.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Architecture Decision Records?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each ADR has:

* A title (the main heading of the ADR)
* Status (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated, or Rejected)
* Date of the decision
* Context (the factors that influenced the decision)
* Decision (the actual decision made)
* Consequences (the results of the decision)
* Participants (the people involved in making the decision)

The extension supports various display options, including:

* Light mode (default)
* Dark mode
* Different status colors

=== ADR Components

An ADR includes:

* A title
* Status and date information
* Context section
* Decision section
* Consequences section
* Participants section with stick figure representations

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for ADRs

To include ADRs in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,adr]
----
title: ADR title
status: Accepted
date: YYYY-MM-DD
context: Context point 1
- Context point 2
decision: Decision point 1
- Decision point 2
consequences: Consequence 1
Consequence 2
participants: Jane Smith (Architect), John Doe (Developer), Alice Johnson (Product Manager)
----
....

The macro processes the JSON configuration and generates an SVG representation of the ADR that is embedded in your document.

=== ADR Properties

==== Main Properties

* `title` (required): The main heading of the ADR
* `date` (required): The date when the decision was made
* `status` (required): The status of the decision (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated, or Rejected)
* `context` (required): An array of context statements
* `decision` (required): An array of decision statements
* `consequences` (required): An array of consequence statements
* `participants` (optional): An array of participant names


==== Status Options

[TIP]
====
The `status` property can have one of the following values:

* `Proposed`: Indicates a decision that is being considered (blue)
* `Accepted`: Indicates a decision that has been approved (green)
* `Superseded`: Indicates a decision that has been replaced by a newer decision (amber)
* `Deprecated`: Indicates a decision that is no longer relevant (red)
* `Rejected`: Indicates a decision that was not approved (dark red)
