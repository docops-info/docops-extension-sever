== Introduction

The DocOps Roadmap Visualizer allows you to create professional, interactive product roadmaps in your AsciiDoctor documents. Roadmaps are essential for communicating product strategy, development timelines, and feature priorities to stakeholders, team members, and customers.

This guide will help you understand how to create and customize roadmaps using the DocOps extension, with examples of different configurations and use cases.

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

== Basic Concepts

=== What is a Roadmap?

A roadmap in the DocOps extension is a visual representation of your product or project timeline, organized by quarters or time periods. Each roadmap includes:

* A title and optional subtitle
* Time periods (quarters) displayed horizontally
* Features organized by category and status
* Visual indicators for feature status, priority, and effort
* Optional legend for categories and status indicators

Roadmaps help teams and stakeholders:

* Visualize the product development timeline
* Understand feature priorities and dependencies
* Track progress against planned milestones
* Communicate strategy and vision

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Roadmap Components

A roadmap includes the following components:

* *Header*: Contains the title and subtitle
* *Timeline*: Shows quarters or time periods horizontally
* *Feature Cards*: Individual cards for each feature, containing:
  ** Title
  ** Category (with color coding)
  ** Status indicator
  ** Release date
  ** Description
  ** Optional priority and effort indicators
* *Legend*: Shows category colors and status indicators

== Best Practices

=== Organizing Your Roadmap

* **Group related features**: Place related features in the same category for better organization
* **Balance quarters**: Try to distribute features evenly across quarters to avoid overloading
* **Highlight priorities**: Use the priority field to emphasize important features
* **Be realistic with timelines**: Set achievable deadlines for features
* **Update regularly**: Keep your roadmap up-to-date as priorities and timelines change

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Visual Design Tips

* **Use clear titles**: Make your roadmap title descriptive and specific
* **Keep descriptions concise**: Feature descriptions should be brief but informative
* **Use status effectively**: Accurately represent the current status of each feature
* **Consider dependencies**: Show relationships between features when relevant
* **Choose appropriate dimensions**: Adjust width and height based on the number of features and quarters

=== Multiple Features in Same Quarter

The DocOps Roadmap Visualizer intelligently handles quarters with many features by automatically arranging them in multiple columns when there are more than 4 features in a single quarter. This ensures optimal use of space and maintains readability.

**Key Features of Multi-Feature Layout:**

* **Automatic Column Layout**: When more than 4 features are assigned to a quarter, they're automatically arranged in multiple columns to optimize space usage
* **Responsive Spacing**: Vertical spacing adjusts dynamically to ensure all features fit within the available height
* **Consistent Alignment**: Features remain properly aligned within their quarter boundaries
* **Visual Hierarchy**: Status indicators and category colors help distinguish between different features
* **Scalable Design**: Works effectively with any number of features per quarter

**Best Practices for High-Density Quarters:**

1. **Use Descriptive Titles**: Keep feature titles concise but meaningful
2. **Leverage Categories**: Use consistent category colors to group related features
3. **Status Indicators**: Clearly differentiate between completed, current, planned, and future features
4. **Priority Levels**: Use priority indicators to highlight critical features
5. **Adjust Dimensions**: Increase width and height for quarters with many features

This layout automatically handles the visual complexity of busy quarters while maintaining the clean, professional appearance that makes roadmaps effective communication tools.

=== Optimizing for Large Roadmaps

When creating roadmaps with many features, consider these configuration options:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,roadmap]
----
title=Enterprise Roadmap
subtitle=Comprehensive feature timeline
width=1600        # Increased width for more features
height=1200       # Increased height for better spacing
cardWidth=140     # Slightly smaller cards for more density
cardHeight=100    # Compact card height
quarters=Q1 2024,Q2 2024,Q3 2024,Q4 2024,Q1 2025,Q2 2025
showLegend=true   # Legend helps with many categories
data=|
---
# Your feature data here
----
....

**Performance Considerations:**

* **Optimal Width**: 1400-1600px provides good balance between readability and space efficiency
* **Height Scaling**: Allow 150-200px per 4 features in the busiest quarter
* **Card Sizing**: Slightly smaller cards (140x100px) work well for dense layouts
* **Legend Placement**: Always include legend for roadmaps with multiple categories


== Conclusion

The DocOps Roadmap Visualizer provides a powerful way to create professional, interactive roadmaps in your AsciiDoctor documents. By using the simple table-based syntax, you can create customized roadmaps that clearly communicate your product strategy, development timeline, and feature priorities.

The extension supports various configuration options, allowing you to tailor the roadmap to your specific needs, whether you're planning a small project or a multi-year product strategy.
