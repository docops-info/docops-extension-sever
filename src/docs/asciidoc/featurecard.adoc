== Best Practices

=== Creating Effective Feature Cards

1. **Keep Descriptions Concise**: Aim for 1-2 sentences that clearly communicate the value proposition.
2. **Choose Relevant Emojis**: Select emojis that visually represent the feature or concept.
3. **Use Consistent Color Schemes**: Maintain visual harmony by using complementary colors or a consistent color theme.
4. **Provide Meaningful Details**: Include 2-4 detail points that expand on the feature's capabilities or benefits.
5. **Group Related Features**: Organize cards logically to tell a cohesive story about your product or service.
6. **Consider the Layout**: Choose the layout that best suits your content and the context in which it will be displayed.
7. **Match Theme to Context**: Use the light theme for light backgrounds and the dark theme for dark backgrounds.

=== Design Tips

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Place the most important features first in grid layouts, or at the top in column layouts.
2. **Color Psychology**: Use colors strategically (e.g., blue for trust, green for growth, red for important features).
3. **White Space**: The cards are designed with appropriate spacing, so don't overcrowd with too much text.
4. **Interaction Cues**: Inform users that cards are interactive by adding a note or instruction above the cards.

== API

The Feature Card Maker provides a REST API for generating feature cards:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Endpoint |Description

|GET /api/featurecard
|Returns an HTML form for creating feature cards

|POST /api/featurecard/render
|Processes the input data and returns the rendered SVG
|===

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

* If cards are not appearing, check that your table format is correct with proper column separators (`|`).
* If emojis don't display correctly, ensure you're using valid Unicode emoji characters.
* If the layout doesn't look right, verify that you've specified a valid layout option (`grid`, `row`, or `column`).
* If colors appear incorrect, confirm that you're using one of the supported color schemes.
* If details aren't showing when clicking a card, make sure you've added detail lines starting with `>>` immediately after the card's main data row.
* Long text in descriptions and details will automatically wrap to fit within the card boundaries, so you don't need to worry about text overflow.
