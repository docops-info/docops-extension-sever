title: Migrate Database to NoSQL Solution
status: Rejected
date: 2024-05-20
context:
- We're experiencing performance issues with our relational database
- Some of our data doesn't fit well into a relational model
- We anticipate significant growth in data volume
- We want to improve horizontal scalability
decision:
- We will not migrate from [[https://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL]] to [[https://www.mongodb.com/ MongoDB]]
- We will instead optimize our existing PostgreSQL setup
- We will implement caching strategies for performance-critical queries
- We will consider a hybrid approach for specific use cases
consequences:
- Avoid disruption of existing systems and processes
- Leverage team's existing SQL expertise
- Miss potential benefits of NoSQL for certain data patterns
- Need to invest in [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/performance-tips.html PostgreSQL optimization]] and tuning
