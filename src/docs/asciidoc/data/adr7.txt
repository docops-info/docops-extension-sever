title: Implement Data Lake Architecture
status: Accepted
date: 2024-06-20
context:
- We need a centralized repository for all our data assets
- Current data silos are preventing cross-functional analytics
- We need to support both structured and unstructured data
- Future machine learning initiatives require access to historical data
decision:
- We will implement a data lake architecture using cloud storage
- We will use a layered approach (raw, cleansed, and curated zones)
- We will implement data cataloging and metadata management
- We will establish data governance policies for the lake
consequences:
- Improved data accessibility across the organization
- Reduced data duplication and inconsistencies
- Increased storage costs initially
- Need for new skills in data engineering and governance
