title: Adopt GraphQL for API Layer
status: Accepted
date: 2024-07-15
context:
- Our REST APIs have become complex with many endpoints
- Mobile clients need to fetch data from multiple endpoints
- Different clients need different data shapes
- We need to reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data
decision:
- We will adopt GraphQL for our API layer
- We will maintain existing REST endpoints for backward compatibility
- We will implement a gradual migration strategy
- We will use Apollo Server for the GraphQL implementation
consequences:
- More efficient data fetching for clients
- Improved developer experience with self-documenting API
- Potential learning curve for the team
- Need for new tooling and monitoring
