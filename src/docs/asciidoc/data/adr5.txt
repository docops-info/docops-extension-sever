title: Use JWT for Authentication
status: Superseded
date: 2023-11-15
context:
- We need a stateless authentication mechanism
- We want to reduce database lookups for auth verification
- We need to support authentication across [[https://microservices.io/ multiple services]]
- We need to include authorization claims in the token
decision:
- We will use [[https://jwt.io/ JWT (JSON Web Tokens)]] for authentication
- We will implement token refresh mechanism
- We will store tokens in HTTP-only cookies
- We will include basic user permissions in the token
consequences:
- Stateless authentication reducing server load
- Simplified authentication for microservices
- Potential security risks if tokens are compromised
- Limited token size due to being included in every request
