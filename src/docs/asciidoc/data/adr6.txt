status: Deprecated
date: 2022-09-10
context:
- We need to optimize initial page load performance
- SEO is important for our content-heavy application
- We need to support users with slower internet connections
- We want to reduce client-side JavaScript processing
decision:
- We will use Next.js for server-side rendering
- We will implement incremental static regeneration for content pages
- We will use client-side hydration for interactive components
- We will implement code splitting for performance optimization
consequences:
- Improved initial page load times
- Better SEO performance
- Reduced client-side processing requirements
- Increased server resource usage
- More complex deployment architecture
