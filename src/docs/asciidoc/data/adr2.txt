title: Adopt Microservices Architecture
status: Accepted
date: 2024-06-01
context:
- Our monolithic application is becoming difficult to maintain and scale
- Development teams need to work independently on different parts of the system
- We need to improve deployment frequency and reduce time-to-market
- Different components have different scaling requirements
decision:
- We will gradually migrate from monolith to microservices architecture
- We will use [[https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html domain-driven design]] to identify service boundaries
- We will implement an [[https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway API gateway]] for client communication
- We will use containerization ([[https://www.docker.com/ Docker]]) and orchestration ([[https://kubernetes.io/ Kubernetes]])
consequences:
- Improved scalability and resilience
- Faster development cycles and independent deployments
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for robust service discovery and monitoring
