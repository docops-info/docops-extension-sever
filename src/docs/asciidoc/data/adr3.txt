title: Implement GraphQL API Layer
status: Proposed
date: 2024-06-10
context:
- Our REST APIs require multiple round trips for complex data requirements
- Mobile clients need efficient data loading with minimal bandwidth
- Frontend teams need more flexibility in data fetching
- API versioning and documentation are becoming challenging
decision:
- We will implement a GraphQL API layer on top of existing services
- We will use Apollo Server for the GraphQL implementation
- We will maintain existing REST APIs for backward compatibility
- We will develop a phased migration plan for clients
consequences:
- More efficient data fetching for clients
- Reduced network overhead for mobile applications
- Self-documenting API with introspection
- Learning curve for teams unfamiliar with GraphQL
- Additional complexity in the API layer
