status: Accepted
date: 2024-05-15
context:
- Our application needs robust search capabilities across multiple data types
- We need to support full-text search with relevance ranking
- The search functionality must scale with growing data volumes
- We need to support faceted search and filtering
decision:
- We will use Elasticsearch as our search engine
- We will integrate it with our existing PostgreSQL database
- We will implement a synchronization mechanism to keep data in sync
consequences:
- Improved search performance and capabilities
- Additional infrastructure to maintain
- Need for expertise in Elasticsearch configuration and optimization
- Potential complexity in keeping data synchronized
