== Introduction

The DocOps Swimlane Extension allows you to create visually appealing and informative swimlane diagrams in your AsciiDoctor documents. Swimlanes are useful for visualizing workflows, processes, and project statuses in a structured and visually engaging way.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of swimlanes, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different swimlane visualizations.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Swimlanes?

Swimlanes in the DocOps extension are SVG-based visual elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each swimlane has:

* A title (the main heading of the diagram)
* Multiple lanes (columns), each with its own title
* Items within each lane, each with a title and content
* Optional theme configuration (light or dark)

Swimlanes are particularly useful for:

* Visualizing workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
* Showing project status across different teams or components
* Representing process flows with parallel activities
* Organizing tasks or features by category or status

=== Swimlane Components

A swimlane diagram includes:

* A title for the overall diagram
* Multiple lanes (columns), each with:
  * A lane title (header)
  * One or more items containing:
    * An item title
    * Item content (bullet points or text)

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Swimlanes

To include swimlanes in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,swim,width=900,height=450]
----
title=Your Swimlane Title
dark=false
width=900
height=450
---
## Lane 1 Title
### Item 1 Title
- Item 1 content point 1
- Item 1 content point 2

## Lane 2 Title
### Item 2 Title
- Item 2 content point 1
- Item 2 content point 2

## Lane 3 Title
### Item 3 Title
- Item 3 content point 1
- Item 3 content point 2
----
....

The macro processes the data and generates an SVG representation of the swimlane diagram that is embedded in your document.

=== Table Format

The table format uses a simple markdown-like syntax:

* Configuration parameters are specified before the `---` separator
* Each lane starts with `## Lane Title`
* Each item within a lane starts with `### Item Title`
* Content points are listed with bullet points (`-` or `*`)

=== JSON Format

Alternatively, you can use JSON format for more control:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,swim,width=900,height=450]
----
{
  "title": "Your Swimlane Title",
  "useDarkTheme": false,
  "width": 900,

            "Item 1 content point 2"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Lane 2 Title",
      "items": [
        {
          "title": "Item 2 Title",

          ]
        }
      ]
    },

== Advanced Usage

=== Using JSON Format for Complex Swimlanes

For more complex swimlanes, you can use the JSON format directly:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,swim]
----

  "useDarkTheme": false,
  "width": 900,
  "height": 450,
