== Introduction

Planners organize tasks into now/next/later/done columns—classic Kanban-style visualization for roadmaps, sprints, and project planning. Each column shows what's in progress, queued, backlog, or completed.

=== Key Features

* *4-column layout* - NOW, NEXT, LATER, DONE stages
* *Task cards* - Title + description per task
* *Color-coded columns* - Visual distinction by stage
* *Glass design* - Modern, layered appearance
* *Auto-sized cards* - Dynamic height based on content

== Basic Planner

Simple roadmap with tasks across stages:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,planner,title="Q2 Roadmap"]
----
- now User Authentication
Complete OAuth2 integration and JWT token handling
- next API Documentation
Generate OpenAPI specs and interactive docs
- later Mobile App
Native iOS and Android applications
- done Database Migration
PostgreSQL upgrade completed successfully
----
....

== Common Use Cases

* *Sprint planning* - Organize current sprint, backlog, and completed items
* *Product roadmaps* - Show feature progression from now to future
* *Project phases* - Break down project into stages with clear status
* *Team workflows* - Visualize what each team is working on currently
* *Release planning* - Track features across release milestones

== Format Options

=== Basic Structure

[source]
----
- now Task Title
Task description goes here

- next Another Task
Another description

- later Future Task
Planning notes

- done Completed Task
What was accomplished
----

=== Common Options

* `title="Your Title"` - Planner heading
* `useDark=true` - Enable dark theme

=== Task Format

Each task starts with `- stage` (now, next, later, done) followed by:
- Line 1: Task title
- Line 2+: Task description (until next `- stage`)

== Best Practices

* *Limit NOW to 2-4 items* - Keep current focus small and achievable
* *NEXT for immediate queue* - 3-5 items ready to start
* *LATER for backlog* - Don't overload; prioritize top items only
* *DONE for wins* - Show recent completions to celebrate progress
* *One-line titles* - Keep task titles concise; details in description

[TIP]
====
For sprint planning, use NOW for current sprint work, NEXT for sprint backlog, LATER for product backlog, and DONE for last sprint's accomplishments. This creates a rolling window of team velocity.
