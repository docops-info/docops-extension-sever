== Introduction

The DocOps Shield Extension allows you to create visually appealing badges and shields in your AsciiDoctor documents. Shields are useful for displaying status information, version numbers, build status, and other metadata in a visually consistent way.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of shields, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of shields.

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Shields?

Shields in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each shield has:

* A label (the left part of the shield)
* A message (the right part of the shield)
* Optional URL for making the shield clickable
* Optional logo/icon
* Customizable colors for both label and message sections
* Customizable font color

The extension supports various styling options, including:

* Custom colors for label and message sections
* Icons from the SimpleIcons library - see link:../icons[browsable icons]
** syntax would be <github> as an example
* Dark mode
* Custom font colors
* Links to external resources

=== Shield Components

A shield includes:



* A label (left side)
* A message (right side)
* Optional URL for making the shield clickable
* Optional logo/icon
* Color settings for visual appearance

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Shields

To include shields in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. The extension supports two input formats: pipe-delimited and JSON.

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Pipe-Delimited Format

Here's the basic format for pipe-delimited input:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,badge,controls=true]
----
Label|Message|URL|LabelColor|MessageColor|Logo|FontColor
----
....

The macro processes the pipe-delimited configuration and generates an SVG representation of the shield that is embedded in your document.

=== JSON Format

Alternatively, you can use JSON format for more complex configurations:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,badge,controls=true]
----
[
  {
    "label": "Status",
    "message": "Stable",
    "labelColor": "#3C3D37",
    "messageColor": "#4CC9F0"
  },
  {
    "label": "Version",
    "message": "1.0.0",
    "labelColor": "#0D47A1",
    "messageColor": "#2196F3",
    "url": "https://example.com/version",
    "logo": "<tag>",
    "fontColor": "#fcfcfc"
  }
]
----
....

The JSON format allows you to specify multiple badges with all available properties in a structured format.

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Shield Properties

* `Label` (required): The text for the left part of the shield
* `Message` (required): The text for the right part of the shield
* `URL` (optional): The URL to link to when the shield is clicked
* `LabelColor` (optional): The color for the label background (default: #999999)
* `MessageColor` (optional): The color for the message background (default: #ececec)
* `Logo` (optional): The logo to display on the shield (e.g., <github> for GitHub logo)
* `FontColor` (optional): The color for the text (default: #000000 for light backgrounds, #fcfcfc for dark backgrounds)

NOTE: The Badge Generator now only requires `Label` and `Message`. All other fields are optional and will use sensible defaults when omitted. This makes the simplest shield syntax just two fields: `Label|Message`.


=== Shield Configuration

You can customize the appearance and behavior of your shields by including configuration options in your shield data. The configuration is specified as a JSON object at the beginning of your shield data.

==== Configuration Properties

* `type`: The visual style of the badges (default: "classic")
** Options: "classic", "glassmorphic", "neon", "brutalist", "gradient", "minimal", "neumorphic"
* `theme`: The theme to apply (default: "auto")
** Options: "auto", "light", "dark", "both"
** "auto" adapts to user's system preferences
** "both" displays badges in both light and dark variants
* `spacing`: The spacing between shields in pixels (default: 8)
* `fontFamily`: Custom font family for badge text (default: system font)
* `direction`: The arrangement of shields (default: "vertical")
** Options: "vertical" or "horizontal"
* `perRow`: Number of badges per row when using grid layouts (default: 5)
* `style`: The style of the shields (legacy: "ios" or "material")
* `arrangement`: The arrangement of shields - "HORIZONTAL", "VERTICAL", or "GRID" (legacy configuration)
* `backgroundStyle`: The style of the container background
* `animationEnabled`: Whether to enable animations (default: true)

==== Badge Style Options

The `type` configuration allows you to choose from six distinct visual styles:

* **GLASSMORPHIC**: Modern frosted glass effect with blur and transparency
* **NEON**: Vibrant glowing effect with bold colors and shadows
* **BRUTALIST**: Raw, minimalist design with stark contrasts and geometric shapes
* **GRADIENT**: Smooth color transitions with depth and dimension
* **MINIMAL**: Clean, simple design focusing on typography and whitespace
* **NEUMORPHIC**: Soft 3D effect with subtle shadows and highlights

==== Configuration Example

Here's an example of how to include the new configuration in your shield data:

=== Extensive Examples Library

To help you get started quickly, we provide an extensive library of ready-to-use badge lines grouped by common themes (CI/CD, performance, documentation, security, technology stack, community, UX, project management, environments, and more).

- How to use:
  - Copy any of the lines you want (each line is a single badge in `Label|Message` form, with optional fields).
  - Paste them inside a `[docops,badge]` block in your document.
  - You can mix and match as many lines as you like; each becomes an individual shield.

== Conclusion

The DocOps Shield Extension provides a powerful way to enhance your AsciiDoctor documents with visually appealing badges and shields. By using either the pipe-delimited or JSON configuration format, you can create customized shields that match your document's style and purpose.

The pipe-delimited format offers a simple, concise syntax for basic shield configurations, while the JSON format provides a more structured approach for complex configurations with multiple badges.

The extension supports extensive customization through the `BadgeConfig` options:

* **Six modern badge styles**: Choose from glassmorphic, neon, brutalist, gradient, minimal, or neumorphic designs
* **Flexible theming**: Auto, light, dark, or both theme options to match any documentation style
* **Layout control**: Vertical or horizontal arrangements with customizable spacing and rows
* **Typography**: Custom font families for brand consistency
* **Legacy compatibility**: Continued support for iOS and Material Design styles

Each style offers unique visual characteristics:

* **Glassmorphic** for modern, premium aesthetics with frosted glass effects
* **Neon** for bold, tech-forward projects with glowing accents
* **Brutalist** for raw, functional designs emphasizing clarity
* **Gradient** for smooth transitions and visual depth
* **Minimal** for clean, professional documentation
* **Neumorphic** for soft 3D effects and tactile interfaces

With the examples provided in this guide, you can create badges and shields for various use cases, including CI/CD status, version information, security and compliance, technology stack, documentation status, and social media links—all with the visual style that best represents your project's identity.
