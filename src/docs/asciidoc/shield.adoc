== Introduction

The DocOps Shield Extension allows you to create visually appealing badges and shields in your AsciiDoctor documents. Shields are useful for displaying status information, version numbers, build status, and other metadata in a visually consistent way.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of shields, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of shields.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Shields?

Shields in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each shield has:

* A label (the left part of the shield)
* A message (the right part of the shield)
* Optional URL for making the shield clickable
* Optional logo/icon
* Customizable colors for both label and message sections
* Customizable font color

The extension supports various styling options, including:

* Custom colors for label and message sections
* Icons from the SimpleIcons library - see link:../icons[browsable icons]
** syntax would be <github> as an example
* Dark mode
* Custom font colors
* Links to external resources

=== Shield Components

A shield includes:



* A label (left side)
* A message (right side)
* Optional URL for making the shield clickable
* Optional logo/icon
* Color settings for visual appearance

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Shields

To include shields in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. The extension supports two input formats: pipe-delimited and JSON.

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Pipe-Delimited Format

Here's the basic format for pipe-delimited input:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,badge,controls=true]
----
Label|Message|URL|LabelColor|MessageColor|Logo|FontColor
----
....

The macro processes the pipe-delimited configuration and generates an SVG representation of the shield that is embedded in your document.

=== JSON Format

Alternatively, you can use JSON format for more complex configurations:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,badge,controls=true]
----
[
  {
    "label": "Status",
    "message": "Stable",
    "labelColor": "#3C3D37",
    "messageColor": "#4CC9F0"
  },
  {
    "label": "Version",
    "message": "1.0.0",
    "labelColor": "#0D47A1",
    "messageColor": "#2196F3",
    "url": "https://example.com/version",
    "logo": "<tag>",
    "fontColor": "#fcfcfc"
  }
]
----
....

The JSON format allows you to specify multiple badges with all available properties in a structured format.

=== Shield Properties

* `Label` (required): The text for the left part of the shield
* `Message` (required): The text for the right part of the shield
* `URL` (optional): The URL to link to when the shield is clicked
* `LabelColor` (optional): The color for the label background (default: #999999)
* `MessageColor` (optional): The color for the message background (default: #ececec)
* `Logo` (optional): The logo to display on the shield (e.g., <github> for GitHub logo)
* `FontColor` (optional): The color for the text (default: #000000 for light backgrounds, #fcfcfc for dark backgrounds)

== Conclusion

The DocOps Shield Extension provides a powerful way to enhance your AsciiDoctor documents with visually appealing badges and shields. By using either the pipe-delimited or JSON configuration format, you can create customized shields that match your document's style and purpose.

The pipe-delimited format offers a simple, concise syntax for basic shield configurations, while the JSON format provides a more structured approach for complex configurations with multiple badges.

The extension supports various customization options, including custom colors, logos, links, and dark mode, allowing you to create shields that effectively communicate status information and metadata in your documentation.

With the examples provided in this guide, you can create badges and shields for various use cases, including CI/CD status, version information, security and compliance, technology stack, documentation status, and social media links.

The extension now supports both iOS and Material Design style shields:

* iOS-style shields provide a modern and visually appealing option with features like gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, and interactive hover animations.
* Material Design-style shields offer a clean, structured appearance following Google's Material Design guidelines with flat colors, subtle shadows, and consistent spacing.
