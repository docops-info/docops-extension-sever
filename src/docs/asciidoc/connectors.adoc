== Introduction

The DocOps Connector Extension allows you to create visually appealing flow connectors in your AsciiDoctor documents. Connectors are useful for illustrating workflows, processes, and relationships between components.

This guide will help users understand the basic concepts of connectors, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of connectors.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Connectors?

Connectors in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each connector has:

* Text (displayed inside the connector box)
* A description (providing additional context)
* A base color (for visual customization)
* An automatic letter identifier (A, B, C, etc.)

The extension supports different display options, including:

* Regular mode (light background)
* Dark mode (dark background)
* Different output types (SVG, PDF)

=== Connector Components

A connector diagram includes:

* A series of connected boxes, each containing text
* Arrows connecting the boxes in sequence
* Letter identifiers for each box
* A legend with descriptions for each connector

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Connectors

To include connectors in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. The DocOps Connector Extension supports two formats for defining connectors: JSON format and Table format.

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== JSON Format

Here's the basic format using JSON:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
{
  "connectors": [
    {
      "text": "First Step",
      "baseColor": "#E14D2A",
      "description": "Description of the first step"
    },
    {
      "text": "Second Step",
      "baseColor": "#82CD47",
      "description": "Description of the second step"
    },
    {
      "text": "Third Step",
      "baseColor": "#687EFF",
      "description": "Description of the third step"
    }
  ]
}
----
....

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Table Format

Alternatively, you can use a more concise table format to define your connectors:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
---
Text | Description | Color
First Step | Description of the first step | #E14D2A
Second Step | Description of the second step | #82CD47
Third Step | Description of the third step | #687EFF
----
....

The table format has the following structure:

* It starts with `---` to indicate the beginning of the table
* The first row is a header row with column names: `Text`, `Description`, and `Color`
* Each subsequent row represents a connector with its text, description, and color (all separated by `|` characters)
* The `Color` column is optional and defaults to `#E14D2A` if not provided
* The `Description` column is also optional and defaults to an empty string if not provided

The macro processes either the JSON configuration or the table format and generates an SVG representation of the connectors that is embedded in your document.

=== Connector Properties

==== Main Properties

* `connectors` (required): An array of connector objects

==== Connector Object Properties

Each connector in the `connectors` array has the following properties:

* `text` (required): The text displayed inside the connector box
* `baseColor` (optional): The color of the connector (default: "#E14D2A")
* `description` (optional): Additional text describing the connector (default: "")

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Display Options

When using the connector macro, you can specify additional parameters:

* `useDark`: Set to `true` to use dark mode (default: `false`)
* `type`: The output type, either "SVG" or "PDF" (default: "SVG")
* `scale`: A scaling factor for the diagram (default: 1.0)

== Examples

=== Basic Connector Example (JSON Format)

Here's a simple example of a connector diagram using JSON format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector1.json[]
----
....

[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector1.json[]
----

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Basic Connector Example (Table Format)

Here's the same connector diagram using the table format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector2.txt[]
----
....

[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector2.txt[]
----

=== Software Development Lifecycle Example

This example illustrates a software development lifecycle:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,controls=true,css=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector3.json[]
----
....

[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector3.json[]
----

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Dark Mode Connector Example

You can create dark mode connectors by setting the `useDark` parameter to `true`:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,useDark=true,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector4.json[]
----
....

[docops,connector,useDark=true,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector4.json[]
----

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Multi-word Connector Example

Connectors automatically handle multi-word text by displaying each word on a new line:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector5.json[]
----
....

[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector5.json[]
----

=== Cloud Architecture Example

This example illustrates a cloud-based architecture:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector6.json[]
----
....

[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector6.json[]
----

=== CI/CD Pipeline Example

This example illustrates a continuous integration and deployment pipeline:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector7.json[]
----
....

[docops,connector,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector7.json[]
----

=== PDF Output Type Example

This example demonstrates using the PDF output type, which changes the rendering style:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,connector,type=PDF,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector8.json[]
----
....

[docops,connector,type=PDF,controls=true]
----
include::data/connectors/connector8.json[]
----

== Conclusion

The DocOps Connector Extension provides a powerful way to enhance your AsciiDoctor documents with visually appealing flow diagrams. You can create customized connector diagrams that illustrate processes, workflows, and relationships between components using either:

* JSON configuration format - offering full control over all connector properties
* Table format - providing a more concise and readable syntax for simpler diagrams

The extension supports both regular and dark mode displays, with various customization options for colors and descriptions, regardless of which format you choose to use.
