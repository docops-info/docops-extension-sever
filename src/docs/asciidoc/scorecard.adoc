image::icons/ScorecardIcon.svg[Scorecard Icon,80,80]

== Introduction

Scorecards create before/after comparisons that make improvements immediately scannable. Perfect for release notes, migration summaries, and transformation reports where you need to show what changed and why it matters.

=== Key Features

* *Before/After columns* - Side-by-side comparison for instant impact
* *Section grouping* - Organize items by category (features, bugs, security)
* *Visual indicators* - Red bullets (before) vs. green checkmarks (after)
* *Subtitle support* - Add context with subtitle line
* *Dark mode optimized* - Clean appearance in both light and dark themes

== Best Practices

* *Group related items* - Use section headers (===) to organize by category
* *Keep descriptions concise* - One line per item for scanability
* *Lead with impact* - Put highest-impact changes first in each section
* *Use parallel structure* - Keep before/after sections aligned by category
* *Limit to 8-12 items per column* - Too many items lose visual impact

[TIP]
====
For release notes, group by type (Features, Bugs, Security) rather than severity. This makes it easier for different audiences (users vs. ops teams) to scan for what matters to them.
