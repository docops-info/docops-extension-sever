== Introduction

The DocOps Scorecard Extension allows you to create visually appealing comparison charts in your AsciiDoctor documents. Scorecards are useful for comparing two alternatives, showing before and after states, or presenting current vs. proposed solutions.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of scorecards, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of scorecards with various customization options.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Scorecards?

Scorecards in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each scorecard has:

* A title (the main heading of the chart)
* Two column headers (typically for comparing alternatives)
* A series of rows, each with a label and values for both columns
* Optional display settings for customizing the appearance

The extension supports various customization options, including:

* Custom colors for columns and text
* Dark mode charts
* Scaling options
* Font style customization

=== Scorecard Components

A scorecard includes:

* A title bar at the top
* Two column headers (e.g., "Current Solution" and "Proposed Solution")
* Multiple rows, each with:
  ** A row label in the left column
  ** Values for each of the two comparison columns

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Scorecards

To include scorecards in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,scorecard]
----
{
  "title": "Chart Title",
  "initiativeTitle": "First Column Header",
  "outcomeTitle": "Second Column Header",
  "initiativeItems": [
    {"displayText":"Item 1 for first column", "description":"Optional description"},
    {"displayText":"Item 2 for first column"}
    // More items...
  ],
  "outcomeItems": [
    {"displayText":"Item 1 for second column"},
    {"displayText":"Item 2 for second column"}
    // More items...
  ]
}
----
....

The macro processes the JSON configuration and generates an SVG representation of the scorecard that is embedded in your document.

=== Scorecard Properties

==== Main Properties

* `title` (required): The main heading of the chart
* `initiativeTitle` (required): The header for the first column
* `outcomeTitle` (required): The header for the second column
* `initiativeItems` (required): An array of items for the first column
* `outcomeItems` (required): An array of items for the second column

==== Item Properties

Each item in the `initiativeItems` and `outcomeItems` arrays has the following properties:

* `displayText` (required): The text to display in the column
* `description` (optional): Additional description for the item (currently only used for initiativeItems)

==== Display Properties

The scorecard can be customized with various display properties:

* Column colors
* Text colors
* Font styles
* Scale factor
