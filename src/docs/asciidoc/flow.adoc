== Overview

The DocOps Flow Diagram extension allows you to create visually appealing workflow and process flow visualizations in your AsciiDoc documents. Flow diagrams are useful for showing business processes, decision trees, system workflows, and organizing steps into different types of flow elements.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of flow diagrams, how to include them in your AsciiDoc documents, and provide examples of different types of flow visualizations.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Flow Diagrams?

Flow diagrams in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoc documents. Each flow diagram has:

* A title (the main heading of the flow)
* Multiple steps representing different stages or decision points
* Connections between steps showing the flow path
* Optional flow definition with description and theme settings

The extension supports various types of flow steps:

* **start** - Entry points to the workflow
* **common** - Regular processing steps
* **decision** - Decision points with multiple possible outcomes
* **branch** - Conditional processing paths
* **convergence** - Points where multiple paths merge
* **parallel** - Steps that can be executed simultaneously
* **final** - End points of the workflow

=== Flow Components

A flow diagram includes:

* A title
* Flow definition section with description and theme
* Steps table defining each step with type, name, and color
* Connections section defining the relationships between steps

== AsciiDoc Syntax for Flow Diagrams

To include flow diagrams in your AsciiDoc document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,flow]
----
= Your Flow Title

[.flow-definition]
--
description:: Brief description of the workflow
theme:: modern
--

[.steps]
|===
|Type |Name |Color

|start |Step Name |color
|common |Step Name |color
|decision |Step Name |color
|final |Step Name |color
|===

[.connections]
---
Step1 -> Step2 -> Step3
Decision? --Option1--> Branch1
Decision? --Option2--> Branch2
---
----
....

The macro processes the content and generates an SVG representation of the flow diagram that is embedded in your document.

== Step Types

The flow diagram supports several step types, each with distinct visual styling:

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
|Type |Description |Typical Use

|start |Entry point to the workflow |Process initiation, user input
|common |Regular processing step |Data processing, calculations
|decision |Decision point with multiple outcomes |Conditional logic, validation
|branch |Conditional processing path |Error handling, alternative flows
|convergence |Point where multiple paths merge |Joining parallel processes
|parallel |Steps that can execute simultaneously |Concurrent operations
|final |End point of the workflow |Process completion, output
|===

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

== Connection Syntax

The connections section uses a simple syntax to define relationships between steps:

* `->` : Sequential flow (solid arrow)
* `=>` : Parallel flow (double arrow)
* `--Label-->` : Conditional flow with label

Examples:
* `Step1 -> Step2` : Sequential connection
* `Step1 => Step2` : Parallel connection  
* `Decision? --Yes--> NextStep` : Conditional connection

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

== Interactive Features

Flow diagrams in the DocOps extension include several features:

* **Visual Styling**: Each step type has distinct colors and shapes for better categorization
* **Clear Connections**: Arrows and lines show the flow direction and relationships
* **Responsive Design**: Flow diagrams adjust to different screen sizes
* **Theme Support**: Modern theme styling for professional appearance

These features enhance the user experience and make it easier to understand complex workflows and processes.

== Conclusion

The DocOps Flow Diagram extension provides a powerful way to enhance your AsciiDoc documents with visually appealing workflow visualizations. By using the simple syntax format, you can create customized flow diagrams that clearly communicate business processes, system workflows, and decision trees.

The extension supports various step types and connection styles to match your specific workflow requirements and provide clear visual communication of complex processes.
