== Introduction

The DocOps Domain Markup Parser/Generator allows you to create visual domain diagrams using a simple markup syntax. This tool is useful for visualizing domain-driven design (DDD) concepts, organizational structures, or any hierarchical domain relationships in your AsciiDoctor documents.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of domain visualization, how to use the markup syntax, and provide examples of different ways to create domain diagrams.

== Basic Concepts

=== What is Domain Visualization?

Domain visualization in the DocOps extension is a way to represent hierarchical domain structures using a simple markup language. The visualization creates SVG-based diagrams that show:

* Domains (top-level entities)
* Subdomains (second-level entities)
* Sub-subdomains (third-level entities)
* Visual relationships between these entities

The extension supports customizing the appearance of domains and subdomains with different colors, allowing you to create visually distinct and meaningful diagrams.

=== Domain Diagram Components

A domain diagram includes:

* *Domains*: Top-level entities represented as rectangles with titles
* *Subdomains*: Second-level entities that belong to a domain
* *Sub-subdomains*: Third-level entities that belong to a subdomain
* *Separators*: Horizontal lines that can be used to visually separate groups of domains

Each component can have:

* A title (the name of the domain/subdomain)
* A color (optional, to visually distinguish different domains)

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Domain Diagrams

To include domain diagrams in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special markup syntax within the DocOps macro.

=== Basic Syntax

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,domain,controls=true]
----
# Domain Name [color]
## Subdomain Name [color]
### Sub-subdomain Name

# Another Domain [color]
## Another Subdomain [color]
### Another Sub-subdomain
----
....

The markup uses a hierarchical structure with hash symbols (#) to indicate the level:

* `#` - Defines a domain (top level)
* `##` - Defines a subdomain (second level)
* `###` - Defines a sub-subdomain (third level)

=== Color Options

You can specify colors for domains and subdomains using square brackets after the name:

[source,asciidoc]
....
# Finance [blue]
## Accounting [green]
## Budgeting [red]
....

Available color options include:
* blue
* green
* red
* yellow
* purple
* orange
* pink
* gray
* teal
* indigo

You can also use hex colors:

[source,asciidoc]
....
# Marketing [#FF5733]
## Digital Marketing [#C70039]
....

=== Configuration Options

The domain markup parser supports a configuration block that allows you to customize the visual appearance of your domain diagrams. The configuration block starts with `@config{` and ends with `}`, and should be placed at the beginning of your markup.

[source,asciidoc]
....
@config{
useGradients = true
useGlass = true
}
....

Available configuration options:

* `useGradients` - When set to `true`, applies gradient effects to the domain and subdomain backgrounds, creating a more visually appealing and modern look. Default is `false`.
* `useGlass` - When set to `true`, applies a glass-like effect to the domain elements, giving them a translucent appearance with subtle highlights and shadows. Default is `false`.

These visual enhancements can make your domain diagrams more engaging and help distinguish between different domains and hierarchies.

=== Special Features

The markup also supports:

* Comments (lines starting with `//` are ignored)
* Separators (use `---` to create a horizontal line)
* Empty lines (create visual spacing in the markup)

== Examples

=== Basic Domain Structure

Here's a simple example of a domain diagram:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,domain,controls=true]
----
# Technology [blue]
## Software Development [green]
### Frontend Development
### Backend Development
### DevOps

## Data & Analytics [purple]
### Data Science
### Business Intelligence

# Operations [orange]
## HR & Recruitment [red]
## Finance & Accounting [yellow]
----
....


[docops,domain,controls=true]
----
# Technology [blue]
## Software Development [green]
### Frontend Development
### Backend Development
### DevOps

## Data & Analytics [purple]
### Data Science
### Business Intelligence

# Operations [orange]
## HR & Recruitment [red]
## Finance & Accounting [yellow]
----

This creates a diagram with two main domains (Technology and Operations), each with their own subdomains and sub-subdomains.

=== Using Separators

You can use separators to visually group related domains:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,domain,controls=true]
----
# Core Business [blue]
## Product Development [green]
## Sales [teal]

---

# Support Functions [purple]
## HR [pink]
## Finance [yellow]
----
....

[docops,domain,controls=true]
----
# Core Business [blue]
## Product Development [green]
## Sales [teal]

---

# Support Functions [purple]
## HR [pink]
## Finance [yellow]
----

=== Styling with Configuration Options

You can use the configuration options to create different visual styles for your domain diagrams. Here are examples showing the same domain structure with different configuration settings:

== Using the Web Editor

The DocOps Extension Server includes a web-based editor for creating domain diagrams. You can access it at link:../domain/editor.html[editor]. The editor provides:

* A markup editor where you can write your domain structure
* Real-time SVG generation
* Example loading
* SVG downloading
* Syntax guide with examples

The editor makes it easy to experiment with different domain structures and visualize them instantly before including them in your AsciiDoctor documents.
