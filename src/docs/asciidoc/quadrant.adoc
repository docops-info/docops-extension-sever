== Overview

The DocOps Quadrant Chart is a powerful visualization tool for creating strategic priority matrices and impact vs. effort analysis charts. It helps teams prioritize work by plotting items on a two-dimensional grid based on their impact and effort.

== Usage

To create a quadrant chart, use the following syntax in your AsciiDoc document:

== Interpretation

The quadrant chart divides the space into four quadrants:

* **Quadrant 1 (Top-Right)**: High Impact, Low Effort - These are "quick wins" that should be prioritized.
* **Quadrant 2 (Top-Left)**: High Impact, High Effort - These are strategic projects that require significant investment but deliver high value.
* **Quadrant 3 (Bottom-Left)**: Low Impact, Low Effort - These are "fill-ins" that can be done if resources are available.
* **Quadrant 4 (Bottom-Right)**: Low Impact, High Effort - These are "thankless" tasks that should be reconsidered or deprioritized.

== Try It

You can try creating your own quadrant chart using the interactive editor on the https://docops.io/more-capabilities.html#quadrant-example[DocOps More Capabilities] page.
