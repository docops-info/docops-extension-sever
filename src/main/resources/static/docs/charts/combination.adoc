= DocOps Combination Charts
:imagesdir: images

== Introduction

The DocOps Combination Chart Extension allows you to create powerful combination charts that display multiple data series using different chart types (bars and lines) on the same chart. This is particularly useful for visualizing related metrics that have different scales or units, such as revenue (bars) and growth rates (lines), or sales volume (bars) and profit margins (lines).

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of combination charts, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of combination charts with various styling options.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Combination Charts?

Combination charts in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each combination chart has:

* A title (the main heading of the chart)
* Multiple data series that can be either BAR or LINE type
* Support for dual Y-axes (primary and secondary) for different data scales
* X-axis labels (typically categories or time periods)
* Optional display settings for customizing the appearance
* Interactive legend showing all data series

The extension supports various features including:

* Mixed BAR and LINE series on the same chart
* Dual Y-axis support for different data scales
* Smooth curved lines or straight line segments for line series
* Customizable colors for each series
* Dark mode support for better visibility in dark-themed documents
* Grid lines and axis ticks for better readability
* Responsive scaling and sizing options

=== Combination Chart Components

A combination chart includes:

* A title
* One or more data series, each with:
  ** A series name (shown in the legend)
  ** A chart type (BAR or LINE)
  ** A set of data points, each with an x-label and y-value
  ** An optional color specification
  ** A Y-axis assignment (PRIMARY or SECONDARY)
* A legend showing all data series with their types
* Grid lines and axis ticks
* Support for dual Y-axes when needed
* Display settings for visual appearance

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Combination Charts

To include combination charts in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. The DocOps extension uses a tabular format for combination charts:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,combination]
----
title=Chart Title
xLabel=X-Axis Label
yLabel=Primary Y-Axis Label
yLabelSecondary=Secondary Y-Axis Label
useDark=false
showGrid=true
showLegend=true
smoothLines=true
showPoints=true
dualYAxis=true
Series Name | Type | X-Value | Y-Value | Color | Y-Axis
---
Revenue | BAR | Q1 | 50000 | #3498db | PRIMARY
Revenue | BAR | Q2 | 65000 | #3498db | PRIMARY
Growth Rate | LINE | Q1 | 15.5 | #e74c3c | SECONDARY
Growth Rate | LINE | Q2 | 18.2 | #e74c3c | SECONDARY
----
....


The macro processes this tabular data and generates an SVG representation of the combination chart that is embedded in your document.

=== Combination Chart Configuration

The configuration parameters are specified at the beginning of the content, followed by a separator line (`---`), and then the actual chart data.

==== Parsing Format

Combination charts use the unified parsing framework provided by the DocOps Extension Server. The content is divided into two sections:

1. **Configuration Section**: Contains key-value pairs in the format `key=value` before the `---` separator
2. **Data Section**: Contains the chart data after the separator in a tabular format

For more information about the parsing framework, see the xref:../parsing.adoc[Parsing Utilities] documentation.

==== Configuration Parameters

* `title` (optional): The main heading of the chart (default: "Combination Chart")
* `xLabel` (optional): Label for the x-axis
* `yLabel` (optional): Label for the primary y-axis
* `yLabelSecondary` (optional): Label for the secondary y-axis (when using dual Y-axis)
* `useDark` (optional): Whether to use dark mode styling (default: false)
* `showGrid` (optional): Whether to display grid lines (default: true)
* `showLegend` (optional): Whether to display a legend (default: true)
* `smoothLines` (optional): Whether to display smooth curved lines for LINE series (default: true)
* `showPoints` (optional): Whether to display data points on LINE series (default: true)
* `dualYAxis` (optional): Whether to enable dual Y-axis support (default: false)
* `useGlass` (optional): Whether to enable glass effect styling for bars (default: false)
* `baseColor` (optional): Base color for the chart theme (default: "#4361ee")
* `backgroundColor` (optional): Background color for the chart (default: "#f8f9fa")
* `scale` (optional): Scaling factor for the chart (default: 1.0)

==== Data Format

The data for the combination chart is specified in a tabular format with the following columns:

[source]
----
Series Name | Type | X-Value | Y-Value | Color | Y-Axis
----

Where:
* `Series Name` is the name of the data series (shown in the legend)
* `Type` is either "BAR" or "LINE" to specify the chart type for this series
* `X-Value` is the label for the x-axis point (category or time period)
* `Y-Value` is the numerical value for the data point
* `Color` (optional) is the hex color code for this series (e.g., #3498db)
* `Y-Axis` is either "PRIMARY" or "SECONDARY" to specify which Y-axis to use

== Advanced Features

=== Dual Y-Axis Support

When your data series have significantly different scales (e.g., revenue in thousands vs. percentages), you can use the dual Y-axis feature by setting `dualYAxis=true` and assigning series to either `PRIMARY` or `SECONDARY` Y-axis.

=== Glass Effect Support

Enable glass effect styling for bars by setting `useGlass=true` in the configuration. This creates a modern, translucent appearance with realistic lighting effects including:

* Layered glass overlay with transparency gradients
* Radial highlights for realistic light reflections
* Top shine highlights for depth
* Enhanced drop shadows and blur effects
* Interactive hover effects with glow and scaling

The glass effect works well with both light and dark modes and provides a premium, modern appearance for your charts.

=== Dark Mode Support

Enable dark mode by setting `useDark=true` in the configuration. This provides better contrast and readability in dark-themed documents.

=== Customization Options

* **Colors**: Specify custom colors for each series using hex color codes
* **Line Styles**: Control whether lines are smooth curves or straight segments with `smoothLines`
* **Data Points**: Show or hide data points on line series with `showPoints`
* **Grid**: Control grid visibility with `showGrid`
* **Legend**: Control legend visibility with `showLegend`
* **Scaling**: Adjust chart size with the `scale` parameter

== Best Practices

1. **Use Dual Y-Axis Wisely**: Only use dual Y-axis when your data series have significantly different scales
2. **Color Selection**: Choose contrasting colors for different series to improve readability
3. **Data Clarity**: Ensure your data points are meaningful and contribute to the story you're telling
4. **Dark Mode**: Consider your document's theme when choosing between light and dark modes
5. **Legend**: Keep series names concise but descriptive for better legend readability

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

* **Data Not Displaying**: Ensure all required columns are present in the data section
* **Incorrect Scaling**: Check that Y-axis assignments (PRIMARY/SECONDARY) are appropriate for your data
* **Color Issues**: Verify that color codes are valid hex values (e.g., #3498db)
* **Chart Type**: Ensure chart types are specified as either "BAR" or "LINE" (case-sensitive)

=== Tips

* Test your charts with both light and dark modes to ensure readability
* Use meaningful series names that will display well in the legend
* Consider the overall document layout when setting chart dimensions
* Preview your charts to ensure all data is visible and properly scaled
