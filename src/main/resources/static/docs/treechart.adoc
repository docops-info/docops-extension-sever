== Introduction

The DocOps Tree Chart Extension allows you to create interactive hierarchical tree diagrams in your AsciiDoctor documents. Tree charts are useful for visualizing organizational structures, decision trees, family trees, and any hierarchical relationships.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of tree charts, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of tree charts.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Tree Charts?

Tree charts in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that display hierarchical data in a tree-like structure. Each tree chart has:

* A title (the main heading of the chart)
* A root node (the top-level element)
* Child nodes (elements that branch from the root or other nodes)
* Optional display settings for customizing the appearance

The extension supports two main orientations for tree charts:

* Vertical trees - Nodes flow from top to bottom
* Horizontal trees - Nodes flow from left to right

Each tree chart can be displayed in various styles, including:

* Interactive collapsible nodes
* Custom color schemes
* Dark mode
* Modern glass effect
* Fully expanded or initially collapsed views

=== Tree Chart Components

A tree chart includes:

* A root node representing the top-level element
* Child nodes representing hierarchical relationships
* Node labels that describe each element
* Optional custom colors for nodes
* Interactive elements for expanding and collapsing branches (in web view)

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Tree Charts

To include tree charts in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,treechart,controls=true]
----
title=Chart Title
width=800
height=600
orientation=vertical
collapsible=true
expanded=true
darkMode=false
hover=true
colors=#3498db,#2ecc71,#e74c3c,#f39c12,#9b59b6
---
Root Node
    Child Node 1 | #3498db
        Grandchild 1
        Grandchild 2
    Child Node 2 | #2ecc71
        Grandchild 3
        Grandchild 4
    Child Node 3
----
....

The macro processes the configuration and data and generates an SVG representation of the tree chart that is embedded in your document.

=== Parsing Format

Tree charts use the unified parsing framework provided by the DocOps Extension Server. The content is divided into two sections:

1. **Configuration Section**: Contains key-value pairs in the format `key=value` before the `---` separator
2. **Data Section**: Contains the hierarchical tree data after the separator, with indentation indicating parent-child relationships

For more information about the parsing framework, see the xref:parsing.adoc[Parsing Utilities] documentation.

=== Configuration Properties

* `title` (optional): The main heading of the chart (default: "Tree Chart")
* `width` (optional): The width of the chart in pixels (default: 800)
* `height` (optional): The height of the chart in pixels (default: 600)
* `orientation` (optional): The orientation of the tree, either "vertical" or "horizontal" (default: "vertical")
* `collapsible` (optional): Whether nodes can be expanded/collapsed (default: true)
* `expanded` (optional): Whether all nodes are initially expanded (default: true)
* `darkMode` (optional): Whether to use dark mode (default: false)
* `hover` (optional): Whether to enable hover effects (default: true)
* `useGlass` (optional): Whether to apply a glass effect to nodes (default: false)
* `colors` (optional): A comma-separated list of colors to use for nodes (defaults to a predefined color palette)

=== Data Format

After the configuration section and the separator line (`---`), each line represents a node in the tree. The indentation level determines the parent-child relationships:

[source]
----
Root Node [| Color]
    Child Node 1 [| Color]
        Grandchild 1 [| Color]
        Grandchild 2 [| Color]
    Child Node 2 [| Color]
        Grandchild 3 [| Color]
----

* The root node must be at the leftmost position (no indentation)
* Child nodes must be indented with spaces or tabs
* Each node can optionally specify a custom color using the pipe (`|`) separator
* If no color is specified, colors from the configuration or default palette are used

== Advanced Usage

=== Non-Collapsible Tree for PDF Output

When generating PDFs, you might want to ensure all nodes are visible. Set `collapsible=false` and `expanded=true`:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,treechart,controls=true]
----
title=Family Tree
width=800
height=600
collapsible=false
expanded=true
---
Grandparent
    Parent 1
        Child 1
        Child 2
    Parent 2
        Child 3
        Child 4
----
....

=== Custom Color Palette

You can define a custom color palette for your tree chart:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,treechart,controls=true]
----
title=Product Categories
width=800
height=600
colors=#FF5733,#C70039,#900C3F,#581845,#FFC300
