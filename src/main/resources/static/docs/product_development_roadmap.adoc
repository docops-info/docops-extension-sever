= Product Development Roadmap with Semantic Versioning & Release Strategy
:imagesdir: images

== Introduction

This roadmap demonstrates a comprehensive approach to product development using semantic versioning (SemVer) with structured release candidates, milestones, and strategic release planning. The roadmap spans 18 months and shows the evolution from MVP to a mature enterprise platform.

== Semantic Versioning Strategy

Our versioning follows semantic versioning principles:

* **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.1.3)
* **Release Candidates**: Version with -RC suffix (e.g., 1.0.0-RC1)
* **Milestones**: Version with -M suffix (e.g., 1.0.0-M1)
* **Alpha/Beta**: Pre-release versions (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-beta.1)

== Key Versioning Principles

=== Semantic Versioning Rules

1. **MAJOR version** (X.y.z): Incompatible API changes
2. **MINOR version** (x.Y.z): Backward-compatible functionality additions
3. **PATCH version** (x.y.Z): Backward-compatible bug fixes

=== Pre-release Versioning

1. **Milestones (-M1, -M2, -M3)**: Development milestones with specific feature sets
2. **Release Candidates (-RC1, -RC2)**: Feature-complete versions ready for testing
3. **Alpha/Beta**: Early testing versions for internal/external feedback

=== Version Support Policy

* **Active**: Latest major.minor version receives all updates
* **Maintenance**: Previous major.minor versions receive security updates for 12 months
* **Deprecated**: Older versions receive critical security patches for 6 months
* **End-of-Life**: No support, users must migrate to supported versions

=== Migration Strategy

* **Major Version Upgrades**: 6-month migration window with tools and support
* **Breaking Changes**: Comprehensive documentation and automated migration tools
* **Deprecation Notices**: 12-month advance notice for major breaking changes
* **Support Overlap**: Minimum 6-month support overlap between major versions

== Release Candidate Process

=== RC1 - Feature Complete
* All planned features implemented
* Internal testing completed
* API documentation finalized
* Performance benchmarks met

=== RC2 - Production Ready
* Community feedback incorporated
* Security audit completed
* Load testing validated
* Deployment procedures tested

=== GA - General Availability
* Final quality assurance passed
* Support documentation ready
* Customer success team trained
* Monitoring and alerting configured

== Milestone Planning

=== Development Milestones
* **M1**: Core functionality foundation
* **M2**: Integration and connectivity features
* **M3**: Advanced features and optimization

=== Quality Gates
* Code coverage > 85%
* Performance benchmarks met
* Security scan passed
* Documentation complete

=== Feedback Loops
* Weekly milestone reviews
* Community feedback integration
* Customer advisory board input
* Internal dogfooding results

This roadmap provides a comprehensive approach to product development with semantic versioning, ensuring predictable releases, clear migration paths, and sustainable long-term maintenance of multiple product versions.
