== Introduction

The DocOps Callout Extension allows you to create visually appealing and informative callout visualizations in your AsciiDoctor documents. Callouts are useful for highlighting important processes, metrics, and timelines in a structured and visually engaging way.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of callouts, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of callout visualizations.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Callouts?

Callouts in the DocOps extension are SVG-based visual elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each callout has:

* A title (the main heading of the callout)
* A collection of steps or metrics
* Optional metadata

The extension supports three main types of callout visualizations:

* *Systematic Approach* - Displays a step-by-step process with phases, actions, results, and improvements
* *Metrics* - Highlights key metrics in a visually appealing format


=== Callout Components

==== Systematic Approach Components

A systematic approach callout includes:

* A title
* A series of steps, each with:
  * Phase - The stage or phase of the process
  * Action - What is done during this phase
  * Result - The outcome of the action
  * Improvement (optional) - How this step could be improved

==== Metrics Components

A metrics callout includes:

* A title
* A collection of key-value pairs representing important metrics


== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Callouts

To include callouts in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,callout,width=800,height=600]
----
title: Your Callout Title
type=systematic
---
Phase | Action | Result | Improvement
Phase 1 | Action 1 | Result 1 | Improvement 1
Phase 2 | Action 2 | Result 2 | Improvement 2
Phase 3 | Action 3 | Result 3 | Improvement 3
----
....

The macro processes the table data and generates an SVG representation of the callout that is embedded in your document.

=== Table Format

The table format uses a simple pipe-separated syntax:

* The first line after the `---` separator is the header row
* Subsequent rows contain the data for each step
* For metrics callouts, the table has two columns: Metric Name and Value

=== JSON Format

Alternatively, you can use JSON format for more control:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,callout,width=800,height=600,controls=true]
----
{
  "type": "systematic",
  "title": "Your Callout Title",
  "steps": [
    {
      "phase": "Phase 1",
      "action": "Action 1",
      "result": "Result 1",
      "improvement": "Improvement 1"
    },
    {
      "phase": "Phase 2",
      "action": "Action 2",
      "result": "Result 2",
      "improvement": "Improvement 2"
    }
  ]
}
----
....

=== Callout Parameters

==== Block Macro Parameters

* `width` (optional): The width of the SVG in pixels. Default is 800.
* `height` (optional): The height of the SVG in pixels. Default is 600.

==== Block Body Parameters

* `type` (required): The type of callout visualization (systematic, metrics, ). Default is "systematic".
* `title` (required): The title of the callout.
* `useGlass` (optional): Boolean value to enable or disable the glass look and feel. Default is true.

=== Metrics with Custom Formatting

You can use JSON format to create metrics callouts with custom formatting:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,callout,controls=true]
----
{
  "type": "metrics",
  "title": "Website Performance Metrics",
  "metrics": {
    "Page Load Time": "1.2s",
    "First Contentful Paint": "0.8s",
    "Time to Interactive": "2.1s",
    "Bounce Rate": "24%",
    "Conversion Rate": "3.8%",
    "Mobile Traffic": "68%",
    "SEO Score": "92/100",
    "Accessibility Score": "97/100"
  }
}
----
....

[docops,callout,controls=true]
----
{
  "type": "metrics",
  "title": "Website Performance Metrics",
  "metrics": {
    "Page Load Time": "1.2s",
    "First Contentful Paint": "0.8s",
    "Time to Interactive": "2.1s",
    "Bounce Rate": "24%",
    "Conversion Rate": "3.8%",
    "Mobile Traffic": "68%",
    "SEO Score": "92/100",
    "Accessibility Score": "97/100"
  }
}
----

=== Styling Options

You can customize the visual appearance of callouts using the `useGlass` attribute. By default, callouts use a glass-like styling with transparency and highlights. You can disable this to use a more traditional flat design:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,callout,controls=true]
----
{
  "type": "systematic",
  "title": "Project Phases",
  "useGlass": false,
  "steps": [
    {
      "phase": "Planning",
      "action": "Define project scope and requirements",
      "result": "Approved project plan",
      "improvement": "More stakeholder involvement"
    },
    {
      "phase": "Execution",
      "action": "Implement project deliverables",
      "result": "Completed work products",
      "improvement": "Better resource allocation"
    },
    {
      "phase": "Monitoring",
      "action": "Track progress and manage issues",
      "result": "Status reports and issue logs",
      "improvement": "More frequent check-ins"
    }
  ]
}
----
....

[docops,callout,controls=true]
----
{
  "type": "systematic",
  "title": "Project Phases",
  "useGlass": false,
  "steps": [
    {
      "phase": "Planning",
      "action": "Define project scope and requirements",
      "result": "Approved project plan",
      "improvement": "More stakeholder involvement"
    },
    {
      "phase": "Execution",
      "action": "Implement project deliverables",
      "result": "Completed work products",
      "improvement": "Better resource allocation"
    },
    {
      "phase": "Monitoring",
      "action": "Track progress and manage issues",
      "result": "Status reports and issue logs",
      "improvement": "More frequent check-ins"
    }
  ]
}
----

== Conclusion

The DocOps Callout Extension provides a powerful way to enhance your AsciiDoctor documents with visually appealing and informative callout visualizations. By using either the table format or JSON configuration, you can create customized callouts that effectively communicate processes, and metrics.

The extension supports three main types of callouts (systematic, and metrics), making it versatile for different documentation needs. Whether you're documenting a project retrospective, highlighting key performance indicators, the Callout Extension helps you present information in a clear and engaging way.
