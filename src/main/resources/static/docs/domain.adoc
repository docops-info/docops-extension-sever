== Overview

The DocOps Domain Visualizer renders a high-level view of a business or technical domain with:

- A single MAIN node (the domain you‚Äôre describing)
- One or more COMMON capability rows (shared across the domain)
- Zero or more Specialized Groups (verticals or high-level operations with their own rows)

Author diagrams directly in AsciiDoc using a compact CSV-like syntax inside a DocOps block. The server parses the payload and returns an SVG.

== Syntax

The payload is a minimal CSV with a header and rows.

Required lines:

- main,<NAME>
- type,emoji,rowIndex,nodes  (header)

Rows:

- COMMON rows populate the shared capability band across the diagram.
- Any other value in the type column becomes a Specialized Group. Its emoji applies to all nodes in that group. Use rowIndex to add multiple rows within the same group.

Column meanings:

- type: COMMON or Group Name (e.g., FRONTEND, BACKEND, PAYMENTS)
- emoji: An optional emoji displayed for each node in that row/group
- rowIndex: 0-based index for the row order within COMMON or the specialized group
- nodes: a quoted, comma-separated list of node titles (no extra quotes inside)

Notes:

- You may specify MAIN as a row (MAIN,,0,"NAME"). If omitted, the first line main,NAME is used.
- Header line is mandatory for the data section: type,emoji,rowIndex,nodes

== Block Attributes

The Domain block supports the standard DocOps attributes described in xref:docops.adoc[DocOps Block Processor]:

[cols="1,1,1,3"]
|===
|Attribute |Type |Default |Description

|controls |Boolean |false |Show the interactive viewer (zoom/copy/fullscreen)
|title    |String  |SVG Viewer |Viewer title (for controls)
|useDark  |Boolean |false |Render using the dark theme palette
|scale    |String  |1.0 |Scale factor sent to the server
|role     |String  |center |Alignment for the rendered block (left/center/right)
|===

== Tips

- Keep nodes concise; multi-word titles are fine (use commas to separate nodes, keep the whole list quoted)
- Use rowIndex to organize large groups into multiple rows
- Emojis help quickly identify specialized groups
- You can also post JSON to the service, but CSV is the simplest path for docs
- Server endpoint behind the scenes is kind=domain
