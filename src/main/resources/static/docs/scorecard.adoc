== Introduction
The Migration ScoreCard Maker renders a two-column before/after scorecard as an SVG based on a simple table-like dTE format.
It uses:
- A title (supports optional subtitle appended as: Title — Subtitle)
- Before and After columns with section headings
- Items within each section (red bullets for Before; green checkmarks for After)

== Usage

Insert a block using the docops extension and the scorecard type:

[docops,scorecard]
----
include::data/scorecard/scorecard1.txt[]
----


[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

NOTE: Within [before.items] and [after.items], use === to create section sub-headers. Items are entered as "Title | Description".

=== Dark Mode

[docops,scorecard, useDark=true, scale=0.75]
----
include::data/scorecard/scorecard2.txt[]
----






== Examples

== Live Preview

- Quick preview endpoint (static design): GET /api/scorecard/view-mode
- Interactive editor: GET /api/scorecard/edit-mode
  - Toggle Dark Mode in the editor; the UI will update the content and re-render.

== Attributes and Sections
- title: Main title. If subtitle is present, output becomes "title — subtitle".
- subtitle: Optional; appended to the title for display.
- useDark: Optional; boolean flag to enable dark mode. Example: useDark=true. Defaults to false.
- scale: Optional; numeric scale for the rendered SVG. Example: scale=1.5 (150% size). Defaults to 1.0.
- [before] and [after]: Begin the respective columns. You may set a header title inside with a line like "title=BEFORE vX.Y".
- [before.items] and [after.items]: Start the items area. Use === Heading to start a subgroup; following lines until next === or --- are items.
- ---: Delimiter to end a section/group and begin another.

== Dark Mode and Scaling
The scorecard now supports dark mode and output scaling through two optional attributes:

- useDark: Set to true to render the dark theme. Defaults to false.
- scale: Set to a numeric factor to scale the SVG output. Defaults to 1.0.

Example:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,scorecard,useDark=true,scale=1.5]
----
include::data/scorecard/scorecard5.txt[]
----
....

[docops,scorecard,useDark=true,scale=1.5]
----
include::data/scorecard/scorecard5.txt[]
----



== Notes

[NOTE]
====
- The current Maker focuses on the two primary columns and grouped item lists consistent with the reference design.
- Additional sections like metrics, optimizations, team, etc., shown in some examples, are not yet rendered by this Maker and will be considered in future iterations.

- Scaling is applied to the final SVG width and height while preserving a fixed internal viewBox for crisp rendering at any scale.
- Dark mode adjusts page background, card panels, strokes, and text colors appropriately while keeping the header gradients and header labels readable.
- You can also combine useDark with other attributes and content as in the usage examples above.
