== Introduction
The Migration ScoreCard Maker renders a two-column before/after scorecard as an SVG based on a simple table-like dTE format.
It uses:
- A title (supports optional subtitle appended as: Title — Subtitle)
- Before and After columns with section headings
- Items within each section (red bullets for Before; green checkmarks for After)

== Attributes and Sections
- title: Main title. If subtitle is present, output becomes "title — subtitle".
- subtitle: Optional; appended to the title for display.
- [before] and [after]: Begin the respective columns. You may set a header title inside with a line like "title=BEFORE vX.Y".
- [before.items] and [after.items]: Start the items area. Use === Heading to start a subgroup; following lines until next === or --- are items.
- ---: Delimiter to end a section/group and begin another.

== Notes
- The current Maker focuses on the two primary columns and grouped item lists consistent with the reference design.
- Additional sections like metrics, optimizations, team, etc., shown in some examples, are not yet rendered by this Maker and will be considered in future iterations.
