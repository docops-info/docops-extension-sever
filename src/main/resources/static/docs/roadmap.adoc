== Introduction

The DocOps Roadmap Visualizer allows you to create professional, interactive product roadmaps in your AsciiDoctor documents. Roadmaps are essential for communicating product strategy, development timelines, and feature priorities to stakeholders, team members, and customers.

This guide will help you understand how to create and customize roadmaps using the DocOps extension, with examples of different configurations and use cases.

== Basic Concepts

=== What is a Roadmap?

A roadmap in the DocOps extension is a visual representation of your product or project timeline, organized by quarters or time periods. Each roadmap includes:

* A title and optional subtitle
* Time periods (quarters) displayed horizontally
* Features organized by category and status
* Visual indicators for feature status, priority, and effort
* Optional legend for categories and status indicators

Roadmaps help teams and stakeholders:

* Visualize the product development timeline
* Understand feature priorities and dependencies
* Track progress against planned milestones
* Communicate strategy and vision

=== Roadmap Components

A roadmap includes the following components:

* *Header*: Contains the title and subtitle
* *Timeline*: Shows quarters or time periods horizontally
* *Feature Cards*: Individual cards for each feature, containing:
  ** Title
  ** Category (with color coding)
  ** Status indicator
  ** Release date
  ** Description
  ** Optional priority and effort indicators
* *Legend*: Shows category colors and status indicators

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Roadmaps

To include a roadmap in your AsciiDoctor document, use the following syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,roadmap]

....

=== Configuration Options

The roadmap can be customized with the following configuration options:

==== Basic Configuration

* `title`: The main title of the roadmap (default: "Product Roadmap")
* `subtitle`: An optional subtitle (default: "")
* `width`: Width of the SVG in pixels (default: 1200)
* `height`: Height of the SVG in pixels (default: 800)
* `theme`: Color theme, either "light" or "dark" (default: "light")
* `quarters`: Comma-separated list of quarters or time periods (default: "Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4")
* `showLegend`: Whether to display the legend (default: true)
* `animationEnabled`: Whether to enable animations (default: true)

==== Display Configuration

You can customize the display with these additional options:

* `fontColor`: Text color (default: "#1f2937" for light theme)
* `backgroundColor`: Background color (default: "#f8fafc" for light theme)
* `scale`: Scale factor for the entire roadmap (default: 1.0)
* `cardSpacing`: Vertical spacing between cards in pixels (default: 20)
* `quarterSpacing`: Horizontal spacing between quarters in pixels (default: 300)
* `cardWidth`: Width of feature cards in pixels (default: 160)
* `cardHeight`: Height of feature cards in pixels (default: 120)

=== Feature Data Format

The feature data is provided in a table format with the following columns:

* `Title`: The name of the feature
* `Category`: The category the feature belongs to (e.g., core, security, performance)
* `Quarter`: The quarter or time period when the feature is planned
* `Status`: The current status of the feature (completed, current, planned, future, cancelled, on_hold)
* `Release Date`: The planned or actual release date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
* `Description`: A description of the feature
* `Priority` (optional): The priority level (low, medium, high, critical)
* `Effort` (optional): The effort required (small, medium, large, extra_large)
* `Assignee` (optional): The person assigned to the feature
* `Dependencies` (optional): Comma-separated list of feature IDs this feature depends on

== Best Practices

=== Organizing Your Roadmap

* **Group related features**: Place related features in the same category for better organization
* **Balance quarters**: Try to distribute features evenly across quarters to avoid overloading
* **Highlight priorities**: Use the priority field to emphasize important features
* **Be realistic with timelines**: Set achievable deadlines for features
* **Update regularly**: Keep your roadmap up-to-date as priorities and timelines change

=== Visual Design Tips

* **Use clear titles**: Make your roadmap title descriptive and specific
* **Keep descriptions concise**: Feature descriptions should be brief but informative
* **Use status effectively**: Accurately represent the current status of each feature
* **Consider dependencies**: Show relationships between features when relevant
* **Choose appropriate dimensions**: Adjust width and height based on the number of features and quarters

== Conclusion

The DocOps Roadmap Visualizer provides a powerful way to create professional, interactive roadmaps in your AsciiDoctor documents. By using the simple table-based syntax, you can create customized roadmaps that clearly communicate your product strategy, development timeline, and feature priorities.

The extension supports various configuration options, allowing you to tailor the roadmap to your specific needs, whether you're planning a small project or a multi-year product strategy.
