== Introduction

Callouts spotlight key processes, metrics, or timelines in visual formats that make information instantly digestible. Perfect for executive summaries, post-mortems, and documentation where you need to highlight what matters without walls of text.

=== Key Features

* *3 callout styles* - Systematic process, key metrics, timeline events
* *Structured layouts* - Steps, phases, and metrics in clean visual hierarchy
* *Auto-sized cards* - Dynamic height based on content
* *Dark mode optimized* - Polished appearance in both themes
* *Glass morphism design* - Modern, layered visual effects

== Systematic Process Callout

Document step-by-step approaches with phases, actions, and results:

----
title: Software Development Process
type=systematic
---
Phase | Action | Result | Improvement
Requirements | Gather user needs | Detailed requirements document | Involve end-users earlier
Design | Create architecture | Technical specifications | Use more design workshops
Development | Implement features | Working code with tests | Increase pair programming
Testing | Perform QA | Bug reports and validation | Automate more test cases
Deployment | Release to production | Live application | Implement robust CI/CD

== Common Use Cases

* *Post-mortems* - Document incident timeline and resolution steps
* *Process documentation* - Show systematic approaches to problem-solving
* *Executive summaries* - Highlight key metrics and outcomes
* *Project retrospectives* - Timeline of milestones and lessons learned
* *Methodology explanations* - Break down multi-phase approaches

=== Systematic Process

[source,asciidoc]

[docops,callout,width=800,height=600]
----
title: Process Title
type=systematic

Phase | Action | Result | Improvement
Phase 1 | What was done | Outcome achieved | Optional improvement note
Phase 2 | What was done | Outcome achieved | Optional improvement note
----

=== Key Metrics

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,callout,width=800,height=400]
----
title: Metrics Title
type=metrics
---
Metric | Value
Query Performance | 97% reduction in execution cost
Database CPU | Reduced from 88% to 60%
Methodology | Data-driven approach
----
....

=== Timeline Events

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,callout,width=800,height=500]
----
title: Timeline Title
type=timeline
---
Phase | Action | Result
Q1 2024 | Project kickoff | Team formed
Q2 2024 | Design phase | Architecture complete
Q3 2024 | Development | Core features shipped
----
....

=== Common Options

* `type` - systematic, metrics, timeline (required)
* `width=800` - Callout width in pixels
* `height=600` - Base height (auto-expands for content)
* `useDark=true` - Enable dark theme

== Best Practices

* *Use systematic for processes* - Break down complex approaches into clear phases
* *Keep metrics focused* - Limit to 4-6 most important KPIs
* *Timeline for chronology* - Show sequence of events, not detailed steps
* *Add improvement notes* - Use 4th column in systematic to suggest next steps
* *Let height auto-expand* - Don't constrain height; let content determine size

[TIP]
====
For post-mortems, use systematic callouts to document the problem-solving journey. Each phase shows what you tried, what happened, and what you learned—perfect for sharing knowledge across teams.
