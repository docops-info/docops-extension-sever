== Introduction

The DocOps Planner Extension allows you to create visually appealing roadmap visualizations in your AsciiDoctor documents. Roadmaps are useful for showing project timelines, development plans, and organizing tasks into different stages of completion.

This guide will help you understand the basic concepts of roadmaps, how to include them in your AsciiDoctor documents, and provide examples of different types of roadmap visualizations.

== Basic Concepts

=== What are Roadmaps?

Roadmaps in the DocOps extension are SVG-based graphical elements that can be included in your AsciiDoctor documents. Each roadmap has:

* A title (the main heading of the roadmap)
* Multiple columns representing different stages (now, next, later, done)
* Tasks or items within each stage
* Optional display settings for customizing the appearance

The extension supports various styles of roadmaps, including:

* Custom colors for different stages
* Dark mode for better visibility in different environments
* Detailed task descriptions within each stage
* Modern glass design for a premium visual experience

=== Roadmap Components

A roadmap includes:

* A title
* Multiple columns, each representing a stage:
  ** NOW - Current tasks being worked on
  ** NEXT - Tasks planned for the immediate future
  ** LATER - Tasks planned for a later time
  ** DONE - Completed tasks
* Tasks within each stage, with descriptions

== AsciiDoctor Syntax for Roadmaps

To include roadmaps in your AsciiDoctor document, you use a special macro syntax. Here's the basic format:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,planner,title="Your Title", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
- now Task1
Task1 description
- next Task2
Task2 description
- later Task3
Task3 description
- done Task4
Task4 description
----
....

The macro processes the content and generates an SVG representation of the planner that is embedded in your document.

=== Roadmap Properties

==== Main Properties

* `title` (optional): The main heading of the roadmap (default: "Roadmap")
* `useDark` (optional): Whether to use dark mode (default: false)

==== Content Format

The content within the macro follows a specific format:

* Each stage starts with a hyphen followed by the stage name (now, next, later, done)
* The stage name is followed by the task title on the same line
* The task description follows on subsequent lines until the next stage marker

== Examples

=== Basic Roadmap Example

Here's a simple example of a roadmap with tasks in different stages:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,planner,title="Development Roadmap", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner1.txt[]
----
....

[docops,planner,title="Development Roadmap", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner1.txt[]
----

[.back-to-top]
<<top, 🔝>>

=== Dark Mode Roadmap Example

One can create a dark mode roadmap by setting the `useDark` property to `true`:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,planner,title="Product Launch Plan", useDark=true,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner2.txt[]
----
....

[docops,planner,title="Product Launch Plan", useDark=true,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner2.txt[]
----

=== Project Management Roadmap Example

Here's an example of a roadmap for project management:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,planner,title="Website Redesign Project", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner3.txt[]
----
....

[docops,planner,title="Website Redesign Project", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner3.txt[]
----

=== Software Release Roadmap Example

Here's an example of a roadmap for software releases:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,planner,title="Software Release Roadmap", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner4.txt[]
----
....

[docops,planner,title="Software Release Roadmap", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner4.txt[]
----

=== Personal Development Roadmap Example

Here's an example of a roadmap for personal development:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,planner,title="Learning Path: Full Stack Developer", useDark=true,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner5.txt[]
----
....

[docops,planner,title="Learning Path: Full Stack Developer", useDark=true,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner5.txt[]
----

=== Glass Design Example

The following example demonstrates the modern glass design applied to a roadmap:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[docops,planner,title="Project Roadmap with Glass Design", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner6.txt[]
----
....

[docops,planner,title="Project Roadmap with Glass Design", useDark=false,controls=true]
----
include::data/planner/planner6.txt[]
----

Notice how the glass design creates a modern, sophisticated look with translucent elements, subtle shadows, and highlights. The design is automatically applied without requiring any additional configuration.

== Interactive Features

Roadmaps in the DocOps extension include several interactive features:

* **Visual Styling**: Each stage has distinct colors for better categorization
* **Card Layout**: Tasks are displayed in card-like containers for clear separation
* **Responsive Design**: Roadmaps adjust to different screen sizes

These features enhance the user experience and make it easier to understand project plans and timelines.

== Glass Design

The latest version of the DocOps Planner Extension includes a modern glass design that enhances the visual appeal of your roadmaps. The glass design features:

* Translucent elements with subtle transparency effects
* Soft highlights and shadows for depth
* Frosted glass appearance for cards and containers
* Smooth gradients and reflections
* Enhanced readability with optimized contrast

The glass design is automatically applied to all roadmap visualizations, giving them a contemporary, polished look. This design approach creates a sense of depth and dimension while maintaining clarity and readability.

=== Glass Design Benefits

* **Modern Aesthetics**: The glass design provides a contemporary look that aligns with modern UI trends
* **Enhanced Readability**: Carefully balanced transparency and contrast ensure content remains highly readable
* **Visual Hierarchy**: The design uses subtle depth cues to establish clear visual hierarchy
* **Consistent Experience**: The glass effect is applied consistently across different elements for a cohesive look
* **Light and Dark Mode Support**: The glass design adapts beautifully to both light and dark mode settings

The glass design is particularly effective in dark mode, where the translucent elements create an elegant, premium appearance against darker backgrounds.
