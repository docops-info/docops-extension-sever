:doctitle: Contributing to DocOps

Hello!

We are establishing the foundation of the DocOps product suite and figuring things out allong the way.  We still need to completely develop this document, but want to invite people that are interested in the promotion of the idea of DocOps and want to honestly collaborate with us in developing our vision and products.  Feel free to contribute in these ways or more.

. Saying Hello to the Dev Team and promoting the idea of DocOps
. Product Feedback
. Feature Request
. Documentation Assistance
. Capturing Bugs
. Contributing Code

For those that want to contribute code, we are planning on following the github standard contribution flow.

. Fork the project.
. Create a topic branch from master.
. Make some commits to improve the project.
. Push this branch to your GitHub project.
. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
. Discuss, and optionally continue committing.
. The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.
. Sync the updated master back to your fork.
