=== Notes
* Version bump: patch (visual/documentation-level changes only).

== [2025.10] - 2025-10-28

=== Timeline
* Added horizontal timeline rendering alongside existing vertical layout.
* Config-based layout switching via optional front-matter separated by a line with exactly `---`; supports `type=H|V` (case-insensitive). Defaults to vertical when omitted or invalid.
* Horizontal rendering follows the provided design at `designs/timeline-h.svg`; vertical rendering path preserved unchanged.

=== Documentation
* Updated `src/docs/asciidoc/timelineshowcase.adoc` with examples for `type=H`, `type=V`, default behavior, and the `---` separator.

=== Tests
* Added unit tests covering config parsing, horizontal vs vertical selection, structural SVG differences, and text wrapping in the horizontal layout.

=== Migration Guidance / Backward Compatibility
* No breaking changes: existing timelines without a config block or with `type=V` continue to render vertically.
* To opt into horizontal layout, add a config block before your timeline payload:
+
+```
+type=H
+---
+date: 1891
+text: Mailbox, invented by Phillip Downing
+```
+
* Unknown config keys are ignored; invalid `type` values default to vertical with a warning in logs.
