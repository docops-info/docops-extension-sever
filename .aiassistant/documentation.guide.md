the project documentation is asciidoctor and markdown focused. the asciidoctor is older than markdown support. the markdown is more streamlined. I like the streamlined approach. the asciidoctor might be outdated as well. what can I do to stream line the documentation? the main index is attached for both type. how to stream line the documentation. also focus on the example visualization. update jetbrans.ai.md as needed when supplying suggestions. inspect the project for examples. use incremental approach to update documentation. focus on 1 visualization at a time so that a pattern is established.
